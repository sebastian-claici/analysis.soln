# Notes for Terence Tao's *Analysis I*

This repository contains self-attempted solutions to the exercises in Terence Tao's [Analysis I](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-i/). I am comfortable with proof based mathematics, but it has been a while since I have done formal analysis, so I make no guarantees at the correctness of the proofs, and I would recommend you use these only as a starting point.

The notes are gathered into a single [PDF file](notes/main.pdf). There is a table of contents for easier navigation.
